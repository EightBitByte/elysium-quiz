A Disco Elysium inspired web app quiz. Run through the quiz of roughly 50 questions, answering on a 1 to 5 scale. Your skills will be evaluated, as they are in the game. Answer honestly, and truthfully! You will be able to read up on each skill afterwards and see what your main skill is.

### Background

I first had the idea to make this quiz after taking the [16personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/) quiz, and realized it could be applied to Disco Elysium, one of my favorite videogames and literary pieces. I'm also learning next.js, so I felt this would be a good way to put it to the test!
